	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
		<br>I am a passionate Backend Developer with strong expertise in Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, and Microservices Architecture.</br>
<br>Over the course of my career, I have designed and developed scalable, secure, and high-performance applications that deliver real value to businesses and users.</br>

<br>My core strength lies in creating robust backend systems that can handle large volumes of data while maintaining speed and reliability.</br>
<br>I have hands-on experience in implementing RESTful APIs, integrating cloud services (AWS/Azure), and working with both SQL and NoSQL databases to build efficient data-driven solutions.</br>

<br>I thrive in collaborative, agile environments, working closely with cross-functional teams to deliver quality software within deadlines.</br>
<br>My passion for clean, maintainable code drives me to follow best coding practices, leverage design patterns, and ensure test coverage through unit and integration tests.</br>

<br>Beyond backend development, I enjoy exploring front-end technologies like React, which helps me build better full-stack solutions and understand end-to-end application workflows.</br>
<br>I am also keen on DevOps practices, including containerization with Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment automation.</br>

<br>I believe in continuous learningâ€”whether itâ€™s experimenting with new frameworks, enhancing performance optimization techniques, or contributing to open-source projects.</br>
<br>My goal is to grow as a developer who not only writes code but also solves problems, improves processes, and delivers impactful software.</br>
